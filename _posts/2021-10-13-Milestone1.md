## Task 1: Warm-up 
#### Question 1
**What issues do you notice by using this metric to rank goalies?**


<img src="/assets/Milestone1_Task1_Question1.png" alt="">{:class="img-responsive"}

The top goalies, with highest save percentages (SV%), played few games without conceding goals. This metric favors goalies who played few games and faced few shots. It doesn't take into consideration the number of games played or the number of shots a goalie has faced.

Example: A goalie who faced three shots and saved them (SV%=1) would have a better save percentage than a goalie who faced 1620 shot and saved 1482 (SV%=1=0.915)

**What could be done to deal with this?**
To deal with this issue, we need to smooth the SV% metric with the number of shots a goalie has faced. We can also consider the number of games/wins of the goalie.


**The Goals Saved Above Average (GSAA)** is a metric that fairly compares goalies performance.

It measures the number of goals a particular goalie saved based on his save percentage and shots against him given the average of both of these categories across the league.
> GSAA = [Shots against x (1 – league-average save percentage)] – goals allowed 

A second option is to consider the number of games played  **(GP)** or the wins **(W)** and combine it with the save percentage **(SV%)**.
We suggest the following formula: 
> Score= SV%*W 

A high score requires that the goalie has won many games and has a good SV%. This penalizes goalies who played few games or has few wins which solves the problem seen in the first question.

#### Question 2
We present a bar plot with player names on the y-axis and save percentage (‘SV%’) on the x-axis, all filtred using our  proposed approach.

#### Question 3


- **GP: Games Played**: A good goalie should have played several games to avoid the bias of having a high SV% while playing few games.
 
	
- **W: Wins**: The number of wins might be a good metric to judge the performance of goalies when coupled with other metrics.

	
- **L: Losses**: Following the smae logic explained previously, the golies could be penalized by using both **Losses** metric and *GA: Goals against* metric.
