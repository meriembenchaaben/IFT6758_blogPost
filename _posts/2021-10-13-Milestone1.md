## Task 1: Warm-up 
#### Question 1
**What issues do you notice by using this metric to rank goalies?**

<figure>
<img src="/assets/milestone1/Milestone1_Task1_Question1.png" alt="">
<figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 1.1: Top goalies using saving percentage metric</figcaption>
</figure>

The top goalies, with highest save percentages (SV%), played few games without conceding goals. This metric favors goalies who played few games and faced few shots. It doesn't take into consideration the number of games played or the number of shots a goalie has faced.

Example: A goalie who faced three shots and saved them (SV%=1) would have a better save percentage than a goalie who faced 1620 shot and saved 1482 (SV%=1=0.915)

**What could be done to deal with this?**
To deal with this issue, we need to smooth the SV% metric with the number of shots a goalie has faced. We can also consider the number of games/wins of the goalie.


**The Goals Saved Above Average (GSAA)** is a metric that fairly compares goalies performance.

It measures the number of goals a particular goalie saved based on his save percentage and shots against him given the average of both of these categories across the league.
> GSAA = [Shots against x (1 – league-average save percentage)] – goals allowed 

A second option is to consider the number of games played  **(GP)** or the wins **(W)** and combine it with the save percentage **(SV%)**.
We suggest the following formula: 
> Score= SV%*W 

A high score requires that the goalie has won many games and has a good SV%. This penalizes goalies who played few games or has few wins which solves the problem seen in the first question.

#### Question 2
We present a bar plot with player names on the y-axis and save percentage (‘SV%’) on the x-axis, all filtred using our  proposed approach.  
<figure> 
<img src="/assets/milestone1/Question1_2.png" alt="">
<figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 1.2: SV% of top goalies using the proposed approach </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Question 3


- **GP (Games Played)**: A good goalie should have played several games to avoid the bias of having a high SV% while playing few games.
 
	
- **W (Wins)**: The number of wins might be a good metric to judge the performance of goalies when coupled with other metrics.

	
- **L (Losses)**: Following the same logic explained previously, the golies could be penalized by using both *Losses* and *GA: Goals against* metrics. 	

- **SA (Shots Against)**: This metric when coupled with the save percentage could be useful for determining the performance of a goalie. A goalie with a good save percentage and a high number of shots against should have a good performance.

- **SO (Shutouts)**	: A shutout is credited to a goaltender who successfully stops the other team from scoring during the entire game. This might be an extra indicator for the performance of goalies. However, it should be used alongside with other metrics because it is the effort of the effective defensive play of the whole team although it is credited to the goaltender.

- **GPS (Goalie Point Shares)** This metric estimates the number of points contributed by a player. A good goalie should have a high contribution to the wins of his team.

- **QS (Quality Starts)** This two statistic was developed by Robert Vollman. It measures whether a goalie has played well enough to give his team a chance to win. This makes it a fair znd important measure to compare goalies performance. 

- **GSAA (Goals Saved Above Average)**	This metric is computed using the league's average save percentage with the number of shots a goalie has had. It measures how many shots does a goalie save above what an average goalie would do. It is an essential and important statistic that is widely used in Hockey to evalute the performance of goalies.



## Task 2: Data Acquisition

We encapsulated all the logics responsible of downloading the NHL play-by-play data in a class called ```NHL_API```.
When instantiated, we check in the constructor if a path to the dataset is specified, through the environment variable ```DATASET_DIR_PATH```, otherwise we assign a default value.

```python
class NHL_API:
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Load dataset directory path from .env file
        load_dotenv('../.env')
        self.DATASET_DIR_PATH = os.getenv('DATASET_DIR_PATH')

        if (not self.DATASET_DIR_PATH):
            self.DATASET_DIR_PATH = 'dataset/'
```



To retrieve the data between 2 seasons, we need to call method ```get_nhl_data``` while specifing the start and end seasons (for the season *s/s+1*, the season argument should be *s*).
The method uses ```get_nhl_season``` to retrieve the data of each season and shows the progress of retrieving the data.

In the method ```get_nhl_season```, we check if the data of a particular season already exists in local.
If it exists, it reads it from the local file and returns the results. Otherwise, it calls ```get_nhl_regular``` and ```get_nhl_playoffs``` respectively to retrieve the data of both regular season and playoffs for this season.
Then, the results are saved in local for future usage.

```python
    def get_nhl_data(self, start_season, end_season):
        """Return the NHL play-by-play data between two seasons.

        :param start_season: start season (start_season/start_season+1)
        :type a: int
        :param end_season: end season (end_season/end_season+1)
        :type b: int

        :rtype: list
        :return: NHL play-by-play data of all seasons between start_season and end_season
        """
        progress_bar = tqdm(range(start_season, end_season + 1))
        data = []
        for season in progress_bar:
            progress_bar.set_description(f'Retrieving NHL data for season {season}/{season + 1}')
            data.extend(self.get_nhl_season(season))
            progress_bar.set_description(f'Data saved to {self.DATASET_DIR_PATH}')

        return data


    def get_nhl_season(self, season):
        """Return the NHL play-by-play data for one season (regular season and playoffs)

        :param season: season (season/season+1)
        :type a: int

        :rtype: list
        :return: NHL play-by-play data of season/season+1
        """

        filepath = os.path.join(self.DATASET_DIR_PATH, f'data-{season}.npy')

        # check if the data already exists in local
        if os.path.exists(filepath):
            return np.load(filepath, allow_pickle=True)

        data = []
        data.extend(self.get_nhl_regular(season))
        data.extend(self.get_nhl_playoffs(season))

        # save the data in local for next usage     
        np.save(filepath, data)

        return data
```

The code below illustrates how we retrieved the data for both *regular season*  and *playoffs*.

The method ```get_nhl_regular```  goes through the game ids of the regular season and retrieves the data of each game.
In regular seasons, a game id has the following format:

    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 2.1: Format of the game id for regular seasons</figcaption>
</figure>

The method ```get_nhl_playoffs```  goes through the game ids of the playoffs and retrieves the data of each game.
In playoffs, a game id has the following format:

<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question2_2.png" style="width:40%; margin:auto;">

Figure 2.3 illustrates an example of usage of our **NHL_API** module.

    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 2.3: An example of usage of our NHL API module</figcaption>
</figure>

In this example, we extract the data from the 2016-17 season all the way up to the 2020-21 season.
For each season, if the data exists in local, then we simply read and return it. 
Otherwise, we retrieve it from the NHL API and we save it in local for future usage.
The path to the local dataset is given by the environment variable ```DATASET_DIR_PATH```.


## Task 3: Interactive Debugging Tool
<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question3_1a.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <!-- <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question3_1b.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;"> -->
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 3.1: Two examples of our interractive debug tool.</figcaption>
</figure>

This tool allows the user to interractively explore hockey games across seasons, and select the season _(2016-2017 to 2020-2021)_, type of game _(`R` for Regular games, `P` for Playoff games)_, specific game and specific event in a game. 
For each event the user will see the type of event _(shot / goal)_, players involved _(shooter and goalie names)_, as well as exact rink coordinates and a plot illustrating the location of the shot and target net. 

## Task 4: Tidy Data
#### Question 1
**In your blog post, include a small snippet of your final dataframe (e.g. using head(10)). You can just include a screenshot rather than fighting to get the tables neatly formatted in HTML/markdown.**

<figure>
<img src="/assets/milestone1/Question4_1.png" alt="">
<figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 4.1: First 10 rows of tidy data</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Question 2
**You’ll notice that the “strength” field (i.e. even, power play, short handed) only exists for goals, not shots. Furthermore, it doesn’t include the actual strength of players on the ice (i.e. 5 on 4, or 5 on 3, etc). Discuss how you could add the actual strength information (i.e. 5 on 4, etc.) to both shots and goals, given the other event types (beyond just shots and goals) and features available. You don’t need to implement this for this milestone.**

Let's say there is an event that causes an imbalance of strength (ex. bench penalty).
In such a cause, the information regarding strength disparity and the current players per team in the rink could be stored and used to populate the information in the coming events.
If an event brings back the strength to even (ex. bench penalty period has elapsed), this new information is used for the following events.
This way, any event will know the current strenght and number of players at that given time. 

#### Question 3
**In a few sentences, discuss some additional features you could consider creating from the data available in this dataset. We’re not looking for any particular answers, but if you need some inspiration, could a shot or goal be classified as a rebound, or a shot off the rush?**

I would add an event for own goals. This type of even is rare but it happens (A compilation of own goals in the NHL is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyczU_hy78k&t=323s&ab_channel=DeltaHighlights">here!</a>).
I would also attempt to make each event more uniform by making them have the same fields. For example, instead of not having a field "empty net" for 'Shot' events, it could have "empty_net: nan". Considering the concept of making new classifications for shots and goals, I would go as far as changing all 'Goal' events to be 'Shot' events, and shots that are goals would be a subset of this type of event.

## Task 5: Simple Visualizations 
### Question 1
<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_1.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.1: Overlaid count of shots and goals, grouped by type of shot.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the figure above we observe that for the Season 2020-2021:
 - the **most frequent** type of shot is the **Wrist Shot**.
 - the **most dangerous** type of shot is the **Tip-In** followed by **Deflected** shots, with 18% and 15% goal rates, respectively. This order can sometimes be reversed depending on the season.

### Question 2
<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_2_2016.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_2_2017.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_2_2018.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_2_2019.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_2_2020.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.2: Goal percentages by distance from net for each season.</figcaption>
</figure>

The **relationship between the distance a goal was taken** and the **chance it was a goal** is **inversely proportional**, and exponentially decreasing. This relationship is very clear up until around 75 ft of distance, and much noisier afterwards, likely due to the infrequent nature of really distant shots. This observation is coherent with the rules of hokey as a missed shot across the Center Line would risk infringing the Icing rule.

This relationship seems constant, i.e. it **does not change over the past 3 seasons**. This makes sense intuitively, as farther shots are harder to aim and likelier to be defended (higher likelihood of defending players along the way, longer reaction time for goalie).

### Question 3
<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_3.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_3_kde.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.3: Goal percentages by distance from net and shot type, either scaled by the number of shots of its type and distance, or as a density plot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question5_3_violin.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.4: Violin plot showing shots and goals by distance from net and shot type.</figcaption>
</figure>

Based on the plots above we can observe that:
- Generally, shots that are closer to the net, are likelier to be goals
- When close to the net _(< 25ft)_, most shots are dangerous _(>= 40% chance of goal)_ except for Wrap-around and Tip-In shots
- Deflected shots tend to be very dangerous, as they are generally very close to the net and require faster goalie reaction time
- Wrist Shots, Snap Shots and Slap Shots are least effective between 50 and 75 ft of distance
- A 50ft Slap Shot is about as effective as a 25ft Wrist Shot _(~10% goal rate)_
- Wrap Around shot are NOT very dangerous, even when extremely close-up _( > 20% chance of goal for most wrap-around shots)_




## Task 6: Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps

<!-- Export the plot to HTML, and embed it into your blog post. Your plot must allow users
to select any season between 2016-17 and 2020-2021, as well as any team during the
selected season.
Note: Because you can find these figures on the internet, answering these questions
without producing these figures will not get you any marks! -->

#### Question 1 

To prepare the required data for the shot map, we use the following formula to compute the excess shots for each team in the league for a given season: 

> AverageExcessShots(team, season) = (NumberOfShots(team, season) - AverageLeagueShots(season)) / totalPlayedTime(team, season) 

 

The excess shots are computed per *1 feet* for each *(x,y)* in the rink, where x and y are integers.   Since the rink is symmetric, we normalized the data and used one side (half of the rink). 

Then, we used a heatmap to plot our data with the rink image as a background. 

To smooth our plot, we use kernel density estimation with a Gaussian kernel. It allows to smooth and estimate the density at each point in the rink using its neighbors. 

We tried several values of *sigma* (standard deviation) of the gaussian kernel, and we found that ```sigma = 2 ft``` gave good results which makes sense given the dimensions of the rink (height: 58ft; width: 200ft). Using bigger values of sigma would give biased results as a given point would be smoothed using far away points. 

 

We made sure that the colors of the heat map have significant meanings. In case the value of the excess shot is positive (a.k.a that team tends to shoot from that position with a higher frequency than the average of all teams in the league that year) then the corresponding region is colored by blue. If the team tends to shoot with a frequency less than the average, then the red color is used otherwise regions from which a team generates shots at the league average rate of shots are shown in white 

 
We implemented the shot map in two different ways as decribed in the following.

As shown in the figure below, we used ```ipywidgets``` to create this interactive shot map with the possibility of selecting particular team and season. 

 

<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question6_2.png" style="width:90%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.1: Interactive shot map - option 1</figcaption>
</figure>

 

As a second way of doing this, we used ```plotly.graph_objects``` which is a graphing library for creating interactive charts and maps in Python. 

Figure 6.2 shows the interactive shot map created using this library and that was exported as html.  

Several configurations are proposed to choose the season, team, color scale, heatmap or contour, etc.

></iframe>
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.2: Interactive shot map - option 2 </figcaption>
</figure>

- Note: We didn't normalize the values of the colorbar, so that we can interpret theh values properly. Normalizing these values between -1 and 1 would take off their meaning. So, we preferred to keep the values
 



#### Question 2

These plots (shot maps) can be used to have an idea about the offensive play of each time. 
Such plots would allow to approximate how much a team creates scoring opportunities.
We can also estimate how likely a given team is dangerous with respect to the rink positions (if it generate shots more than the league average from certain positions). 
We can also have an idea about the play style of each team if they generate more shots in front of the net or from far away positions.
Shot maps are also useful to compare the performance of the teams across seasons.



#### Question 3

In Figure 6.3, we show the shot map of *Colorado Alavanche* during the season 2016/2017, using our 2 visualization options.  

<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question6_2_colorado2016_v1.png" style="width:75%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question6_2_colorado2016_v2.png" style="width:100%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.3: Shot map of Colorado Avalanche - 2016/2017</figcaption>
</figure>

It is obvious that this team was struggling in generating shots and creating scoring opportunities during this season compared to the league average.
The excess shots per 1 feet ranges between -0.01 and 0.01.
We note also that it generates less shots than the league average in front of the net which might mean that this teams is facing difficulties in reaching the net.
This is explained by the standing that this team occupied during that season as shown in Figure 6.4.

<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/standings-2016.png" style="width:75%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.4: NHL standings - 2016/2017</figcaption>
</figure>
During that season, *Colorado Alavanche* had the last place in the NHL league with poor statistics.



Unlike the seson 2016/2017, the *Colorado Alavanche* team had a great performance according to the shot map (Figure 6.5) as it creates many shots as compared to the league average in the 2020/2021 season.
It generates many shots from the different positions, more specifically in front of the net, which allows it to be dangerous and to create several scoring opportunities.
We note in the colorbar of the shotmap that the excess shots values of this team are positive.
This means that *Colorado Alavanche* generated more shots, compared to the league average, from different positions.


<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question6_2_colorado2020_v1.png" style="width:75%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Question6_2_colorado2020_v2.png" style="width:100%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.5: Shot map of Colorado Avalanche - 2020/2021</figcaption>
</figure>

This strong performance justifies the positions of this team during the 2020/2021 season.


<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/standings-2020.png" style="width:75%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.6: NHL standings - 2020/2021</figcaption>
</figure>


*Colorado Alavanche* held the first position at the NHL league during that season, this great performance is justified by the offensive behavior of this team and the several scoring opportunities it creates compared to others from the different positions in the rink.



#### Question 4


 Consider the Buffalo Sabres, which have been a team that has struggled over recent
years, and compare them to the Tampa Bay Lightning, a team which has won the
Stanley for the past two years in a row. Look at the shot maps for these two teams from
the 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons. 

Discuss what observations you can make.

Is there anything that could explain the Lightning’s success, or the Sabres’ struggles?



Figure 6.7 illustrates the shot maps of *Buffalo Sabres* for 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons.
We note that this team is generating less shots than the league average in many positions (negative excess shot at many positions in the rink).
Another observation that we note from the shot maps concerns the spread of shots. 
The *Buffalo Sabres* generates shots more often in the last third of the rink.
This means that the play style of this team is not enough diversified and this may has an impact on the team performance since the opposing team will be expecting this playstyle.

This poor performance justifies the last positions that this team has held during last seasons.

<figure >
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Buffalo-2018.png" style="width:75%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Buffalo-2019.png" style="width:75%; margin:auto;">
    <img src="/assets/milestone1/Buffalo-2020.png" style="width:75%; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.7: Shot map of Buffalo Sabres for 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons</figcaption>
</figure>

On the other hand, Figure 6.8 illustrates the shot maps of *Tampa Bay Lightning* for 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons.
These shot maps show that this team is performing well and is creating more shots than the league average from the different positions, especially in front of the rink. This justifies the Lightning’s success and their great performance that allowed them to win the
Stanley for the past two years in a row.

Unlike *Buffalo Sabres*, *Tampa Bay Lightning* has a diversified play style as we see it generates several shots from different positions in the rink. This makes it an unexpectable team that create several and diversified scoring opportunities and can variate its play to surprive the opposing team. This play a main role in the success of this team.

</figure>




Even though a shot map provides important information on a team's performance, there are some other indicators as well that contribute in evluating the performance of a given team. 
The number of goals, average of scored goals per game, shots and goals against, number of wins and losses, the statistics of the different players, etc. are all useful and important metrics that determine the performance of a given team and that a shot map does not provide.
Therefore, shot maps proovide useful and interesting information about each team performance on the rink compared to others. 
However, to draw a complete picture of this situation we need also to refer to other visualizations and metrics to determine the efficiency and performance of these two teams along the given seasons.
