## Task 1: Warm-up 
#### Question 1

<img src="/assets/Milestone1_Task1_Question1.png" alt="">{:class="img-responsive"}
The top 5 goalies, with the highest 'SV%', played ONE game without conceding goals. This metric favors goalies who played few games and faced few shots. It doesn't take into consideration the number of games played and the number of shots the goalie has faced. e.g., A goalie who faced three shots and saved them all (SV%=1) would have a better SV% than a goalie who faced 1620 shot and saved 1482 (SV%=1=0.915)We should also consider the number of shots the goalie. The Goals Saved Above Average (GSAA) is a metric that fairly compares goalies performance. It measures the number of goals a particular goalie saved based on his save percentage and shots against him given the average of both of these categories across the league. GSAA = [Shots against x (1 – league-average save percentage)] – goals allowed
